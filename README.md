# ðŸ”¥ News
- *2025.07.02*: We will first release the version that depends on the [GenerativeRL](https://github.com/opendilab/GenerativeRL.git) library on the tmp branch.
- *2025.07.01*: We update WavTokenizer camera ready version for ICCV 2025 and release [project website](https://opendilab.github.io/PRG/)
- *2024.11.29*: We release PRG on arxiv.
  
# Upcoming Features and Changes
We are working on separating the codebase from [GenerativeRL](https://github.com/opendilab/GenerativeRL.git) into its own standalone repository.

## Acknowledgement
The Pretrained Reversible Generation codebase is adapted from the following repositories:
- [Swin-Transformer](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer)
- [GenerativeRL](https://github.com/opendilab/GenerativeRL.git)
- [flow_matching](https://facebookresearch.github.io/flow_matching/)
- [SiT](https://github.com/willisma/SiT)
- [RectifiedFlow](https://github.com/gnobitab/RectifiedFlow)

A huge thanks to the authors of these projects for their outstanding contributions! ðŸŽ‰
