ðŸŽ‰ What I cannot create, I do not understand.


## ðŸ”¥ News
-  We first release the version that depends on the [GenerativeRL](https://github.com/opendilab/GenerativeRL.git) library.
- *2025.07.01*: We update PRG camera ready version for ICCV 2025 and release [project website](https://opendilab.github.io/PRG/)
- *2024.11.29*: We release PRG on arxiv.
  


## What is PRG
PRG proposes to turn a pretrained continuous time flow diffusion generator upside down running the model backward produces multi level features that after light fine tuning serve as an unsupervised representation extractor.


## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later  
- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/) (optional, but recommended)  
- [GenerativeRL](https://github.com/opendilab/GenerativeRL) (temporarily required)


## Installation

### 1. Prepare the environment
```bash
conda create -n prg-env python=3.10  
conda activate prg-env
```

### 2. Install GenerativeRL
```bash
git clone https://github.com/opendilab/GenerativeRL.git
cd GenerativeRL
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Install PRG
```bash
git clone https://github.com/opendilab/PRG.git
cd PRG
pip install -e .
```

## Training
Simply select the desired configuration file for the corresponding training stage from the [config](https://github.com/opendilab/PRG/tree/main/config) directory, and run your training. For example:

```bash
cd PRG
accelerate launch example.py
```
